\usage{
load_knitr_cache(
  path,
  eval_promises = TRUE,
  load_packages = TRUE,
  envir = parent.frame()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path to the knitr cache directory.}

\item{eval_promises}{A logical scalar controlling whether the cached objects are loaded as promises,
(as created by \link{lazyLoad}) or whether the promises are evaluated. Defaults to \code{TRUE}, which
evaluates promises. This may be a slow process if there are many large cached objects.}

\item{load_packages}{A logical scalar controlling whether the packages loaded when the document was knit
should be loaded now. Defaults to \code{TRUE}, which loads the packages.}

\item{envir}{The environment to load the cached objects and packges into.
Defaults to the current calling environment}
}
\value{
Returns `NULL` invisibly
}
\description{
Loads the packages and objects stored in a knitr cache. Useful for restoring the
internal state of a knitted document for use in an interactive session without forcing you to
re-run all the code interactively.
}
\details{
The knitr cache directory is usually stored in the same directory as the document. The knitr cache directory naming schema is
`$DOCUMENTNAME$_cache/$OUTPUTFORMAT$/`. So, if your document named "Analysis.Rmd" was knit to HTML
and cached, then the cache would be stored at `Analysis_cache/html/`.

load_knitr_cache("Analysis_cache/html")
